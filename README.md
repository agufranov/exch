**Running**

`npm install`

`npm start`

App will be available on http://localhost:8080.

**Notes**

Here I didn't use real server polling for exchange rates, because I didn't find any free API that provides real-time updates. Therefore, exchange rates are being updated with mock action each 1 second, so you can see these updates in realtime.
